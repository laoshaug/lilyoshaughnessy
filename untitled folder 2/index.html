    <p>The voter registration distribution by party affiliation in different New York State (NYS) counties is depicted in this chart. The percentage of registered voters who identify as Democrats (Dem), Republicans (Rep), or with other affiliations is displayed in each donut chart, which represents a separate county. The charts show the percentage of voters in each county, emphasizing the regional political parties' dominance and diversity. For instance, counties like Allegany and Chenango have a preponderance of Republican voters (over 60%), whereas counties like Albany and Broome exhibit a significant Democratic representation (over 60%). </p>
